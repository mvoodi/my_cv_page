            <p>I was born on a beautiful holiday, Christmas, on January 7, 2005. For 19 years now, I’ve carried the wonderful name Aleksandra. One of the unique things about me is my height—I’m 147 cm tall. While it may be unusual and sometimes inconvenient, I’ve grown to love it as a part of who I am. I also have a passion for traveling. Exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and observing the customs and traditions of other nations is something I deeply enjoy. At the same time, I love sharing stories about my homeland. The way foreigners become curious and fascinated by our country and its people is always exciting to experience.</p>
            <p>In addition to my love for travel, I find great satisfaction in achieving success. Who doesn’t love seeing the fruits of their labor? For me, there's a special kind of joy in witnessing the results of my work, whether it's in small accomplishments or major goals. This drive for success, combined with my curiosity about the world, has shaped who I am today—someone who is constantly eager to learn, grow, and experience new things.</p>

                <p>UNICEF was the first environment where I immersed myself in project work. I worked on two projects, both aimed at benefiting society. The first project focused on combating smoking among youth and students, which involved extensive research and close collaboration with a team. The second project was about supporting teenagers during remote learning, helping them navigate the challenges of distance education.</p>

                <p>I joined Enactus at university, deciding to apply and give it a try. Although my time there was short, it was an incredibly valuable experience. Enactus is a fantastic place to get introduced to startups and explore the work from a different perspective. I led several projects and was introduced to innovative ideas, such as fertilizer made from orange peels and edible cups, among others.</p>

This experience broadened my horizons, enriched my worldview, and significantly improved my financial literacy skills.</p>
