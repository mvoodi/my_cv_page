            <p>I was born on a beautiful holiday, Christmas, on January 7, 2005. For 19 years now, I’ve carried the wonderful name Aleksandra. One of the unique things about me is my height—I’m 147 cm tall. While it may be unusual and sometimes inconvenient, I’ve grown to love it as a part of who I am. I also have a passion for traveling. Exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and observing the customs and traditions of other nations is something I deeply enjoy. At the same time, I love sharing stories about my homeland. The way foreigners become curious and fascinated by our country and its people is always exciting to experience.</p>
            <p>In addition to my love for travel, I find great satisfaction in achieving success. Who doesn’t love seeing the fruits of their labor? For me, there's a special kind of joy in witnessing the results of my work, whether it's in small accomplishments or major goals. This drive for success, combined with my curiosity about the world, has shaped who I am today—someone who is constantly eager to learn, grow, and experience new things.</p>

                <p>UNICEF was the first environment where I immersed myself in project work. I worked on two projects, both aimed at benefiting society. The first project focused on combating smoking among youth and students, which involved extensive research and close collaboration with a team. The second project was about supporting teenagers during remote learning, helping them navigate the challenges of distance education.</p>

              <h3>SeaBattle</h3>
              <p>A console-based implementation of the classic "Battleship" game. This project is a text-based version of the game "Battleship" written in Java. The program creates a 7x7 grid for placing ships of various lengths (single-deck, double-deck, and triple-deck), allows player interaction through the console, enables input of shot coordinates, and tracks hits, misses, and sunk ships. The game supports scoring, player leaderboard sorting, and offers the option to replay.</p>

              <h3>Wheel of Fortune</h3>
              <p>An interactive game inspired by the TV show. This Java program is a console-based word-guessing game that combines elements of team play and competition. Players take turns guessing letters to uncover a hidden word from a shuffled list. During setup, players are registered, and their turn order is randomized. Each hidden word includes a description to provide hints. Players earn points for correctly guessing letters, and they can attempt to guess the entire word to win instantly. If a player reaches the maximum possible score or guesses the word correctly, they are declared the winner. The game also includes features like tracking previously named letters, handling invalid guesses, and offering a final chance for all players to guess the word if one player reaches the maximum score. Various interactive and visual enhancements, such as color-coded text and real-time updates, make the gameplay engaging.</p>

              <h3>Store Management</h3>
              <p>This Java program is a console-based application designed for managing a company with different roles, such as a director, seller, accountant, and warehouse manager. It demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and interacts with a database to manage various operations like adding/removing employees, selling products, updating product prices, and more. The system requires users to log in using predefined credentials for each role. After logging in, they are presented with role-specific menus, which provide functionality for tasks like viewing the company budget, changing salaries, accepting or shipping products, and managing product details. The program is structured with multiple classes and methods that handle the respective responsibilities of each role, supporting efficient employee and product management. The use of OOP allows for modularity and scalability, making it easy to add or modify features as needed.</p>
